//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type Car ={
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any; // Allow arbitrary key-value pairs
}

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, optional:Record< string, any>): Car {
    return{
        manufacturer,
        model,
        ...optional
    };
}

// Call the function with requir
 
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Camry" ,{color:"blue", year:"2023"})
// Print the returned object
console.log(myCar)
