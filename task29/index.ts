// and then write a series of independent if statements that check for
// certain fruits in your array.

//• Make an array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
let favorite_fruits :string[]=['banana','Apple','Orange'];
//• Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of
// fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should
// print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
